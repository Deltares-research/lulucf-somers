    "# Lusos concept\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the general concept how `lusos` works. Under the hood, lusos utilizes the [mapbox-earcut](https://pypi.org/project/mapbox-earcut/) library and [Xugrid](https://deltares.github.io/xugrid/index.html) unstructured grids to derive coverages of polygon geometries in a GeoDataFrame within raster cells of a grid. This is done in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Translate the polygon geometries to triangles, using `mapbox_earcut`, to create an unstructured grid (ugrid) from the geometries.\n",
    "2. Compute the overlap between every triangle in the ugrid and each raster cell from a target grid using [xugrid.OverlapRegridder](https://deltares.github.io/xugrid/api/xugrid.OverlapRegridder.html#xugrid.OverlapRegridder).\n",
    "3. Store the computed overlaps back in the same rectangular space as the target grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, lusos does all this under the hood but for the explanation of the concept we are going to untangle these steps to show how it works. We begin with the necessary imports."
